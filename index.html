            <h3>Cultural Awareness</h3>
            <p>Cultural awareness is a central pillar of Hygge's mission, as we believe that exposure to diverse films and cultures is essential to promoting understanding and empathy. By screening films from different countries and cultures, we aim to broaden our audience's perspectives and encourage them to engage with and appreciate different societies and lifestyles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resolve">
            <h3>Community Building</h3>
            <p>Community building is another important pillar of Hygge's mission. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where students from different faculties and backgrounds can come together to socialize and connect. Through our cinema events, we aim to foster a sense of community and belonging among high school students, helping them to build meaningful relationships and connections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="resolve">
            <h3>Skill Development</h3>
            <p>Skill development is the third pillar of Hygge's mission. By involving students in the planning and execution of our cinema events, we aim to provide them with practical opportunities to develop essential organizational, leadership, and communication skills. We believe that these skills are valuable not just for future careers, but also for personal growth and development. </p>
