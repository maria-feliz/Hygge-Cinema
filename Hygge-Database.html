    <h2>What do we offer?</h2>
    <div class="info2">
        <p>America First refers to a policy stance in the United States that generally emphasizes nationalism and non-interventionism. The term was coined by president Woodrow Wilson. in his 1916 campaign that pledged to keep America neutral in World War I. A more isolationist approach gained prominence in the interwar period (1918–1939) and was advocated by the America First Committee, a non-interventionist pressure group against U.S. entry into World War II. <br><br>In the 1920s, the policy was used by the Ku Klux Klan and informed many of their members who ran for political office. In 2016, while running for a Louisiana Senate seat, David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, publicly claimed that he was "the first major candidate in modern times to promote the term and policy of America first."<br><br>In Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaigns and presidency (2017–2021), Trump used the phrase as a slogan, emphasizing the United States' withdrawal from international treaties and organizations. "America First" was the official foreign policy doctrine of the Trump administration.</p>

            <h2>Film</h2>
            <p>The history of film can be traced back to the late 1800s, when the first motion picture cameras were invented. Early films were short, often only a few minutes long, and were silent. They were usually shown in traveling carnivals and fairs as a novelty. In the early 1900s, the first film studios were established in the United States, and filmmakers began to experiment with different techniques and styles. In 1927, the first "talkie" film, "The Jazz Singer," was released, revolutionizing the industry and paving the way for sound in movies. <br><br>During the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood became the center of the film industry, producing classic films such as "Gone with the Wind," "The Wizard of Oz," and "Casablanca." The 1950s saw the rise of television, and the film industry responded with widescreen formats, color films, and epic productions such as "Ben-Hur" and "The Ten Commandments." In the 1960s and 1970s, a new wave of filmmakers emerged, challenging traditional storytelling and experimenting with new techniques. The French New Wave and the American New Hollywood movements produced classics such as "Breathless," "Bonnie and Clyde," and "The Godfather." <br><br>The 1980s saw the rise of blockbuster films such as "Star Wars," "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," and "Indiana Jones," and the 1990s brought new technology and visual effects to the forefront with films such as "Jurassic Park" and "The Matrix." Today, the film industry continues to evolve, with advances in technology allowing for new storytelling techniques and distribution models. Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have changed the way audiences consume films, and the industry is constantly adapting to keep up with changing trends and technologies.</p>

            <h2>Cinema</h2>
            <p>
                The history of cinema and film are closely intertwined, as cinema refers to the art and practice of making films for public exhibition in theaters. Here is a brief overview of the history of cinema: <br><br>1895-1915: The Lumiere Brothers in France are credited with inventing the cinematograph, a device that could record, develop, and project films. The first public film screening took place in Paris in 1895, and by the early 1900s, cinemas were opening around the world. The first feature-length film, "The Story of the Kelly Gang," was released in Australia in 1906.<br><br>1915-1929: Silent films were the norm during this period, with filmmakers experimenting with storytelling and visual techniques. Famous directors such as D.W. Griffith and Sergei Eisenstein emerged, and Hollywood became the center of the film industry.<br><br>1929-1945: The introduction of sound in films in 1927 changed the industry, with the first "talkie" feature film, "The Jazz Singer," becoming a box office hit. Hollywood continued to dominate, with the studio system controlling the production, distribution, and exhibition of films. <br><br>1945-1960: This period saw the rise of film noir and the development of new cinematic techniques such as widescreen formats and color films. European directors such as Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman gained recognition for their innovative work. <br><br>1960-1980: The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of new cinematic movements, including the French New Wave and American New Hollywood. These filmmakers challenged traditional storytelling and experimented with new techniques. The 1970s also saw the rise of blockbuster films, with "Jaws," "Star Wars," and "Rocky" becoming box office hits. <br><br>1980-2000: The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of special effects and advancements in technology, with films like "Jurassic Park" and "The Matrix" using groundbreaking visual effects. Independent cinema also gained popularity during this time, with directors like Quentin Tarantino and the Coen Brothers making a name for themselves.<br><br>2000-present: Digital technology has revolutionized the film industry, making it easier and cheaper to make and distribute films. The rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime has changed the way audiences consume movies, and films are increasingly being made with a global audience in mind.</p>

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>The film industry has a long history of addressing social awareness and justice issues, reflecting and sometimes even shaping public opinion on various topics. Even in the early days of cinema, social issues were often addressed in films. For example, D.W. Griffith's 1915 film "The Birth of a Nation" depicted the Ku Klux Klan as heroes, sparking controversy and protests. On the other hand, Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film "Modern Times" criticized industrialization and modern society. In the 1960s, as the civil rights movement gained momentum in the United States, films such as "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" and "In the Heat of the Night" tackled issues of racism and discrimination. Sidney Poitier, who starred in both films, became an important figure in promoting racial equality in Hollywood. <br><br>
                In the 1970s and 1980s, the feminist movement and LGBTQ+ rights became more prominent, leading to films such as "Norma Rae," "The Color Purple," and "Philadelphia" that addressed issues of gender and sexual orientation. These films helped to raise awareness and promote social change. In the 2000s, as concerns about climate change and environmental destruction grew, films such as "An Inconvenient Truth" and "The Day After Tomorrow" addressed these issues and helped to raise public awareness. In recent years, the #MeToo movement has sparked a conversation about sexual harassment and assault in the film industry. Films such as "Bombshell" and "The Assistant" have addressed these issues, while the movement has also led to changes in industry practices and increased representation of women in film. 
                <br><br>Overall, the film industry has played an important role in raising awareness of social issues and promoting social justice. While some films have faced controversy and criticism, they have helped to spark important conversations and bring about change.</p>
